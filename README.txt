CALCUFY: Your Smart Math Companion ( first edition )

This if my first project with C++ and my first commitment to github
My motivation to create this project was not a lack of working math tools.
It was a challenge to create one of my own, but faster. For a
first version I aim to use only C++ and terminal.
